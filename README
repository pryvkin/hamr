=== HAMR: High Throughput Annotation of Modified Ribonucleotides
Uses nucleotide patterns in RNA-seq to infer the presence of non-canonical
(covalently modified) nucleotides and/or RNA edits.

=== HAMR v1.2.0 ===

=== Building / Installation
See the "INSTALL" file.


=== Usage
== Required input files
 - BAM file (aligned sequence reads, preferably produced by Bowtie)
    - Note: BAM must be sorted
    - Note: BAM file should only contain uniquely-mapping reads,
              or multimapping reads should be dealt with in some other way
              prior to running HAMR. Cross-mapping reads can cause
              spurious results at high-copy-number loci.
 - Genome sequence FASTA file (must be the same one used to generate the BAM)

== Running HAMR

./hamr.sh [OPTIONS] reads.bam genome.fasta output_prefix

The output will be named <output_prefix>_mods.txt

Type ./hamr.sh --help to see a complete list of options


= Examples
# Require minimum Q score at bases to be 30
#   and place output in output/hamr_mods.txt
./hamr.sh reads.bam genome.fasta output/hamr --min-q=30 

# Ignore 5' and 3' termini of read sequences
./hamr.sh reads.bam genome.fasta output/hamr --exclude-ends

== HAMR Output format

The output is a tab-delimited text file with each row being a site
that was tested for the presence of modifications.

Columns descriptions:
chr       Chromosome
bp        Location on chromosome (zero-based)
strand    Genomic strand of site
refnuc    Reference nucleotide in genomic sequence
A,C,G,T   Observed read counts for each nucleotide at this site
nonref    Count of reads with a mismatch to the reference
ref       Count of reads matching the reference
h1.p      Unadjusted p-value for null hypothesis H0_1
h1.padj   FDR-adjusted p-value for null hypothesis H0_1
h4.p      Unadjusted p-value for null hypothesis H0_4
h4.padj   FDR-adjusted p-value for null hypothesis H0_4
sig       "TRUE" if statistically significant, "FALSE" otherwise
